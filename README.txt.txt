Kyle Berkland's Front End test of sorts.

This was my first time writing Sass and it seemed to be an easy transition from Less to Sass.

I've built this using npm tasks on a wamp server from scratch.

Have not had time to wrap this up in a build folder so as at this stage to run this build, place folder into a wamp server/server and run the index.html inside /src folder on your localhost.

This has taken aroud 6.5hrs to complete.
